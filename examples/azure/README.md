# Provision an Azure cluster

## Overview

This example shows you how to use Hydroform to provision an Azure cluster.

## Installation

### Configure Azure

To provision a Azure cluster you need the client ID and client secret of your azure subscription stored in a TOML file as follows:

```toml
CLIENT_ID = "<my-client-id>"
CLIENT_SECRET = "<my-client-secret>"
```

### Run the example

1. To provision a new cluster on Azure, go to the `hydroform` directory and run:

```bash
go run ./examples/azure/main.go -p {resource_group_name} -c /{path/to/credentials.toml}
```

2. On the Azure portal, go to **Home** > **All Resources** to see your cluster on the list.

4. Export **KUBECONFIG** environment variable pointing to the `kubeconfig` file generated by running the example. This will allow access to the cluster.

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=$(pwd)/kubeconfig.yaml
```
