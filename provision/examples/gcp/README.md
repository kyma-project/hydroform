# Provision a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster

## Overview

This example shows you how to use Hydroform to provision a GKE cluster on Google Cloud Platform.

## Installation

### Configure GCP

To provision a GKE cluster you need a service account the details of which you will pass as properties when executing this example.

1. Log in to GCP. Run:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

Log in using Google Cloud credentials.

2. Go to **IAM & Admin** > **Service accounts**.

3. Click **Create service account**.

6. Optionally, you can grant access to this service account to specific users.

7. Save your configuration.

8. In the main **Service Account**  view, create and store the service account key for your account.

### Run the example

1. To provision a new cluster on GCP, go to the `hydroform` directory and run:

```bash
go run ./examples/gcp/main.go -p {project_name} -c /{path/to/service_account_key.json}
```

2. Go to **Kubernetes Engine** > **Clusters** to see your cluster on the list.

3. Export **GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS** environment variable pointing to the service account key.  

```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS={path/to/service_account_key.json}
```

4. Export **KUBECONFIG** environment variable pointing to the `kubeconfig` file generated by running the example. This will allow access to the cluster.

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=$(pwd)/kubeconfig.yaml
```
